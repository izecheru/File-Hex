# File-Hex

Utility to turn file data into hexadecimal representation

## Example

![test picture](screenshot.png?raw=true)

### Usage

This turns a file into hex representation, you can also provide the file extension for output_file

```
./File-hex <-h> <input_file> <output_file>
```

Reverting a file (you have to provide the file extension yourself)

```
./File-hex <-f> <input_file> <output_file>
```

The whole directory is still a work in progress so it's not tesetd at the moment.
